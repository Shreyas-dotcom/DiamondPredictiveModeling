## Title: Employing Big Data Analytics & Predictive Algorithms to Forecast Diamond Retail Value 



In this Big Data analytics project, we aim to predict the retail value of diamonds based on their characteristics and qualities. The dataset used to train this model consists of over 600,000 data points, and 10 features, including information such as carat weight, cut quality, color grade, clarity grade, depth percentage, table percentage, and the XYZ dimensions of the diamond. Our objective is to create a machine learning algorithm that is capable of accurately estimating the price of a diamond given the above input parameters.
	
 To accomplish this, we evaluate 4 different algorithms:
1.	Linear Regressor
2.	Random Forest
3.	Gradient Boosting
4.	Neural Networks

The performance of these algorithms is evaluated on the training dataset, as well as real-time diamond retail data from Blue-Nile (GIA-certified Diamond Retailer).  Factors considered include accuracy, interpretability, computational efficiency, and the ability to handle numerical and categorical features when selecting the best algorithm for our predictive model. 

The results of these analytics will provide model insights into which algorithm performs the best in terms of estimating diamond prices. The selected algorithm will be able to accurately evaluate the retail value of the diamonds based on the input values, contributing to the understanding of diamond pricing factors, and aiding with the decision-making processes within the diamond industry.
